# CS5621_ML_Irony_Detection
Different Features were tried with different algorithms

Features Used:

  Word count vectors
  
  Word level tfidf scores
  
  Ngram level tfidf scores
  
  Character level tfidf scores
  
 Algorthms Used:
 
  Naive Bayes
  
  SVM
  
  Logistic Regression
  
  Random Forest
  
  Out of different combinations of algorithms and features, word count vectors with logistic regression gave the best accuracy. Character level 
  tfidf scores with logistic regression too performed well, but was not the best.
  
  The python notebooks are organized based on the feature used. And each feature is tried with the four algorithms mentioned above.
